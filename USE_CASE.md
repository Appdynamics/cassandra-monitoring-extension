# AppDynamics Monitoring Extension for use with Cassandra
 
Apache Cassandra is a distributed open source database management system which can handle a large amount of data with high availability. Cassandra is a highly scalable, decentralized system and does not have a single point of failure.

The AppDynamics Monitoring Extension for Cassandra can monitor multiple Cassandra nodes and their resources (caches, client requests etc) as well as the changes in CPU and system data as a result of using Cassandra.

The metrics reported by the extension can be modified as per a user's requirements. The extension was built using Cassandra 3.11 but it would work with previous and future releases as well.
